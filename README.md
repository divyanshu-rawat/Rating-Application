I like to use mysql, so I suggest installing mysql. Once that is installed, execute the following commands don't worry it is inbuilt in Wamp server !.

If you are using wamp you can try this. Just type use your_Database_name first.

Click your wamp server icon then look for MYSQL > MSQL Console then run it.

If you dont have password, just hit enter and type :

mysql> use database_name;

mysql> source location_of_your_file;

If you have password, you will promt to enter a password. Enter you password first then type:

mysql> use database_name;

mysql> source location_of_your_file;

# Method 2 :pencil2:
